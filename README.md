# Datathon2025

What it does
This's a AI model trained with a dataset to predict either an action is going to win or lose.
How we built it
We searched for information about AI models and explainability techniques and tryed our best to solve the challenge.
Challenges we ran into
• Learning and unsderstanding about machine learning in a very short period of time.
• Understanding explainability techniques and applying them to interpratete the graphics obtained. ## Accomplishments that we're proud of
What we learned
• How to train AI models
• Types of Binary Classification
• LLM ## What's next for RainForest
