# 🌳 RainForest (Datathon 2025)

An AI model trained to predict whether an action will succeed or fail. This project was created for the Datathon 2025.

---

## 🚀 What it does

This is an AI model trained with a dataset to predict whether a specific action is going to "win" or "lose" (binary classification).

---

## 🛠️ Built With

* Python
* AI (Machine Learning)
* Database

---

## ⚙️ How we built it

We searched for information about AI models and explainability techniques and tried our best to solve the challenge.

---

## 🧗 Challenges we ran into

* Learning and understanding machine learning in a very short period of time.
* Understanding explainability techniques and applying them to interpret the graphics obtained.

---

## 💡 What we learned

* How to train AI models
* Types of Binary Classification
* Large Language Models (LLMs)

---

## 🔮 What's next for RainForest

* "Improve the model's accuracy with more data"
* More ambiciuos... "Deploy the model as a web API"
